# Next.js

Next.js is a React framework which provides a solution for React project like server-side rendering.

You can see more information in [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)

## Key features & Benefits

1. file-based routing - define pages and routes with files and folders instead of code which is less code, less work and highly understandable
2. server-side rendering - automatic page pre-rendering which great for SEO and initial load
3. Fullstack capabilities - easily add backend code to your Next/React apps which storing data, getting data, authentication etc. can be added to your React projects

## Installation

1. download Node.js
2. use npx to install
   ```
   npx create-next-app project-name
   ```

## Add Page in pages folder

You don't need to install react-router-dom to use router in Next project. Next has already set up all these things. Therefore, index.js is the first page in the root route which is yourdomain/. If you want to add yourdomain/new you have to create new.js in pages/new.js

You can also add nested paths like yourdomain/price/enterprise by create pages/price/enterprise/index.js or pages/price/enterprise.js

## Creating dynamic pages

1. Create [fileName].js in pages folder
2. import useRouter hook from next/router

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function Task() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const taskId = router.query.taskId;
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Task</h1>
      <p>This is {taskId}</p>
    </>
  );
}

export default Task;
```

## Add HTML header and link between pages

- next/head allows you to add HTML header in Next.js
- next/link allows you to add Link component which link between pages. `<a></a>` and `<Link />` have a difference: `<a></a>` will cause page refreshing and request new HTML page but `<Link />` not cause page refreshing which make a smooth transition between pages.

```js
import Head from 'next/head';
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Create Next App</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Generated by create next app" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>
      <main>
        <h1>Next App</h1>
        <Link href="/todolist">Todo List</Link>
        <Link href="/todolist/addTask">addTask</Link>
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```
